# SYNCO: Optimized C++ Concurrency Framework

### Overview
SYNCO (Synchronous Concurrent Orchestration) is a C++ framework designed to enhance multithreading, concurrency, and parallelism in modern software applications. This repository contains the C++ code implementations for the SYNCO framework as described in our research paper, *"An Optimized Framework for Elevating Efficiency in Multithreading."* 

The goal of SYNCO is to tackle the common challenges in concurrent programming such as race conditions, deadlocks, and resource contention while optimizing for performance on multicore processors.

---

## Features
- **Multithreading**: Efficient management of concurrent and parallel tasks using the C++ `<thread>` library.
- **Synchronization Mechanisms**: Thread safety via mutexes, locks, and condition variables to prevent race conditions.
- **Orchestration of Threads**: Dynamic thread orchestration using the `SYNCOOrchestrator` class to ensure optimal task scheduling.
- **Performance Monitoring**: The `SYNCOPerformanceMonitor` allows real-time tracking and optimization of thread performance.
- **Resource Management**: Dynamic resource allocation via `SYNCOResourceManager` for efficient use of system resources.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Use of C++'s `<future>` and `<async>` for non-blocking parallel task execution.

## Code Structure

1. **`SYNCOMutex.hpp`**: Implements a custom mutex class (`SYNCOMutex`) for thread synchronization.
2. **`SYNCOOrchestrator.hpp`**: Manages thread orchestration to optimize thread execution and task allocation.
3. **`SYNCOPerformanceMonitor.hpp`**: Tracks performance metrics during multithreaded operations and optimizes accordingly.
4. **`SYNCOResourceManager.hpp`**: Handles dynamic resource allocation for threads.
5. **`main.cpp`**: Demonstrates the usage of SYNCO's components in a multithreading scenario.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++11 or later compliant compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- **Build Tools**: A build system such as `Make` or `CMake` is recommended for compiling and linking the project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Narendra1920/Research_Paper-Codes-
    cd Research_Paper-Codes-
    ```

2. **Build**:
    If using `Make`:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

    If using `CMake`:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

3. **Run**:
    After building, you can run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./synco-app
    ```

## Performance Results
Performance tests conducted as part of the SYNCO research showed significant reductions in execution times for parallel and concurrent tasks compared to basic methods. These results can be reproduced by running the provided benchmarks.

---

## Future Improvements
- Improved error handling and fault tolerance.
- Advanced dynamic scheduling algorithms in the `SYNCOOrchestrator` class.
- Extended support for distributed systems and networking.
